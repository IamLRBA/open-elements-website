## Building the website

Since the page is based on Hugo and React we use `npm-run-all` to execute several dev executions in parallel.
Therefore you need to install `npm-run-all` as a dev dependency:

```
npm install --save-dev npm-run-all
```


The project is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and you need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) to build the website.
Once Hugo is installed you can host the website on localhost by executing to following command from the root folder of the repository:

```
hugo serve
```

While the process is running the English (default) version of the website can be reached at http://localhost:1313/ and the German can be reached at http://localhost:1314/.
