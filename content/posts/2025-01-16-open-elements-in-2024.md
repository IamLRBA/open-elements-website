The year 2024 at Open Elements was marked by growth and successful project developments.
The company’s strong commitment to the open-source ecosystem was demonstrated by the additional or renewed appointments
of CEO [Hendrik Ebbers]({{< relref "about-hendrik" >}}) to various positions at the **Eclipse Foundation**,
**Eclipse Adoptium**, **Hiero**, the **Linux Foundation**, and the **Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust**.

{{< centered-image src="/posts/2025-01-16-open-elements-in-2024/oss-meets-java.png" width="100%" showCaption="false" alt="Open Elements continues to focus on open source and Java">}}

For Hendrik Ebbers and Open Elements, open source is a matter of the heart, reflected in their company values,
which are consistently upheld and visibly practiced:

- Introducing new people to the community,
- Supporting (academic) talent and sharing knowledge,
- Advancing development,
- Providing help and solutions.

From publications and lectures to conference support, Open Elements once again demonstrated in 2024 that great
dedication pays off, launching the **[Support & Care for Apache Maven™]({{< ref "support-care-maven" >}})**
project—a milestone in the open-source space.

## Engagement

Personal and voluntary commitment are integral to Open Elements’ mission.
In 2024, Hendrik Ebbers was re-elected to the [Board of the Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/directors.php)
(the largest European open-source foundation) and appointed as the lead of the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for Hiero](https://hiero.org/#contribute).
Additional appointments included seats on the Steering Committees of [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/de/) and
[Hiero](https://hiero.org) within the Linux Foundation, as well as on the Technical Advisory Board of the
[Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org).
These re-elections highlight the tangible and lasting impact of Open Elements’ contributions to the open-source ecosystem.

Open Elements is also a member of the [Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group (ORCWG)](https://orcwg.org) within the Eclipse Foundation.
This group facilitates the implementation of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), bridging the gap between regulatory
bodies and the open-source ecosystem to ensure technology adoption aligns with global regulations.

Looking ahead, Open Elements plans to join the [Open Source Business Alliance](https://osb-alliance.de),
Germany’s federal association for digital sovereignty.
The alliance provides a platform to promote improvements in the open-source landscape while fostering connections with
policymakers and public sector organizations. It works to enhance the perception of open source in industry and the broader public.

## Sponsoring & Support

Sponsoring by Open Elements plays a crucial role in advancing the Java and open-source ecosystems.
This includes providing financial resources as well as personal support at local, national, and international levels.
Hendrik Ebbers contributed as the program committee chair for the JavaLand conference and also presented as a speaker.
Similarly, he delivered talks at the OCX conference, sharing his knowledge with many attendees.
Open Elements proudly served as a sponsor for both events.

{{< centered-image src="/posts/2025-01-16-open-elements-in-2024/javaland-sponsoring.jpg" width="100%" showCaption="false" alt="Open Elements as one of the sponsors of the JavaLand conference">}}

Another example of sponsorship and personal involvement is Hendrik Ebbers’ active role in the Java community.
As a co-leader of the JUG Dortmund, several events were organized and funded throughout the year.

During Hacktoberfest, Open Elements’ financial support enabled approximately 30 participants, both local and
international, to actively contribute.
Around 10 participants made their first open-source contributions with guidance from experts.
Through the Open Elements team’s participation in JUG events, new opportunities were created for exploring open-source
projects and fostering a sense of real teamwork.

Networking opportunities are vital for newcomers and seasoned contributors to experience the community firsthand.
To ease entry into the open-source world, tasks of varying difficulty were prepared and supported by detailed
documentation and remote assistance. This was made possible by Open Elements’ investment.
Additionally, financial incentives were provided for high-quality contributions, creating a win-win situation.
For example, a developer from India was rewarded with financial support for his outstanding work and commitment.

## Teaching Assignment at OTH Regensburg

In the winter semester of 2023/24, Hendrik Ebbers held a teaching assignment at OTH Regensburg.
In his lecture on [Distributed Ledger Technology and Digital Trust]({{< ref "dlt-lecture" >}}),
he taught students the foundational skills required to develop DLT-based systems. The course also covered advanced
topics such as smart contracts and NFTs.

*"The programming aspect of the course creates a highly engaging seminar that appeals to both crypto enthusiasts and
traditional software developers alike,"* said one student.

## Own Open-Source Projects and Contributions

Throughout 2024, Open Elements advanced the development of two new in-house projects and contributed to a Google
open-source initiative aimed at enhancing security.

- [BenchScape](https://github.com/OpenElements/BenchScape): This open-source product focused on creating performance
  benchmarks in Java and was regarded as a significant success.
- Another development by Open Elements involved the [Enterprise Java integration for Hedera and Hiero](https://github.com/OpenElements/hiero-enterprise-java).
- Open Elements also made a contribution to a Google open-source project for improved security:
  [Reproducible Builds for Google Auto](https://github.com/google/auto/pull/1695).

{{< centered-image src="/posts/2025-01-16-open-elements-in-2024/github-contributions.png" width="100%" showCaption="false" alt="Open Elements contributed to open source projects every week in 2024">}}

## Hedera & Linux Foundation

With the support of Hedera, IBM, and other notable companies, Open Elements submitted an official proposal to transfer
all Hedera source code to the Linux Foundation.
This move aims to make the decentralized network’s code independent of individual companies, thereby strengthening societal trust.
The proposal was approved, leading to the establishment of Hiero as a Linux Foundation project.

Following this, Open Elements proposed that one of its own open-source software projects also be transferred to the
Linux Foundation and integrated into the Hiero project.
The goal is to create a standardized GitHub Action that will be highly beneficial for many automated quality assurance
measures within the Hiero ecosystem.

{{< youtube-2 id="6jNb3W7ugI8" showCaption="true" alt="Hendrik Ebbers presents Hiero at the OCX Conference of the Eclipse Foundation">}}

As an additional recognition, Hendrik Ebbers, CEO of Open Elements, was appointed as the chair of the Technical Steering Committee
for the Hiero project within the Linux Foundation and promoted to "Director of Open Source" at Hashgraph.

## Funding Received

A significant milestone for Open Elements came at the end of 2024 with the German government's approval of funding to
advance Apache Maven.
This led to the creation of the **[Support & Care for Apache Maven™]({{< ref "support-care-maven" >}})** project,
focused on the sustainable support of critical open-source components.

{{< centered-image src="/illustrations/support-care-logos/support-care-maven-logo.svg" width="80%" alt="Logo of Support & Care for Apache Maven">}}

With this approval, the Sovereign Tech Fund provides the necessary financial resources, enabling Open Elements to
implement much-needed expansions and safeguards for these critical components through mid-2026.
This ensures the reliability and performance of Apache Maven with professional maintenance, regular updates, and the
involvement of experts, some working full-time on the project.

Apache Maven holds a significant position in the Java ecosystem, with over 100 million downloads annually.
However, until now, the system has relied primarily on voluntary efforts without consistent financial backing.

{{< centered-image src="/posts/2025-01-16-open-elements-in-2024/stf-diagram.png" width="100%" showCaption="true" alt="Diagram illustrating the funding process">}}

Open Elements has taken on the responsibility of managing the allocated funding for Apache Maven and is honored by the
trust shown by the Maven community.
The project's status, goals, and funding utilization are transparently documented in a GitHub repository.

Falk Sippach from embarc Software Consulting GmbH described it on
[Heise Developer](https://www.heise.de/blog/Java-Einladung-zur-Mitgestaltung-des-Programms-Support-Care-for-Apache-Maven-9718336.html) as follows:  
*"The trust that the Maven community places in Open Elements as a transparent player in the open-source field is
unparalleled and is what makes this initiative possible in the first place."*
