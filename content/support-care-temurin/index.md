## What is Eclipse Temurin?

Eclipse Temurin™ is a **Java runtime environment (JVM)** based on the OpenJDK™ and distributed by the
Eclipse Foundation under an **open source license**.
Eclipse Temurin is a central project of the Adoptium™ Working Group, which develops and provides
high-quality products and technologies for the Java ecosystem.

{{< centered-image src="temurin-logo.svg" alt="Eclipse Temurin Logo" width="40%" >}}

With over **20 million downloads per month** and 500 million downloads in total,
Temurin is the most widely used Java runtime environment in the world.
In addition, Temurin is not offered by a single company, but rather many of the technology leaders
such as Microsoft or Red Hat are shaping the product together through the Adoptium Working Group.
As a member of the Adoptium Working Group, Open Elements has made a significant contribution to this success.
Our founder [Hendrik Ebbers]({{< relref "about-hendrik" >}}) is a founding member of Adoptium and a member of the
Technical Steering Committee (TSC) of Adoptium's predecessor AdoptOpenJDK.

### Eclipse Temurin is 100% open source

Eclipse Temurin is based on the OpenJDK, which, like all other components of Temurin, is also open source.
This means that the **entire source code of Eclipse Temurin is openly accessible to everyone**.
This even includes the build scripts (description and instructions for creating the Temurin runtime environment)
and the sources of the operating system-specific installers.
The individual steps of building the Temurin distribution are transparent for everyone,
as the Java runtime environment is also built on a publicly accessible build system.
Not only the source code, but also the Temurin artifacts are provided under an open source license.
By artifacts, we mean the distribution or runtime environment that users can download in order to run
their own Java applications on it.
Temurin's open source license is GPL V2 with Classpath Exception.

#### Transparent quality assurance for Temurin

To ensure a **high level of functionality** at all times, all builds are checked by the **Eclipse AQAvit** open source
test and quality framework before release.
AQAvit is also a product of the Adoptium Working Group and is used for the **quality and runtime evaluation**
of Java runtime environments.

{{< centered-image src="aqavit-logo.svg" alt="AQAvit Logo" width="40%" >}}

**Quality criteria for Eclipse Termurin through AQAvit verification:**

- Good performance
- First-class security
- Resilience
- Longevity
- Versatile usability

**Both functional tests and benchmarks** are carried out to verify the use of a Java runtime environment
for the enterprise market.
The results of the AQAvit tests are also openly accessible.
In addition to the use of AQAvit, all Temurin artifacts also undergo the Java Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK),
which originates from Oracle but is unfortunately not openly available.
The specific results may not be published here either.
Only the confirmation that the Temurin builds are TCK verified may be published.

Transparency is a central component of the Adoptium Working Group's philosophy.
For this reason, the [Temurin download figures](https://dash.adoptium.net/) are also openly available.

### Source code and technical information on Temurin

The Temurin source code is stored in several repositories in the GitHub version management system and
can therefore be accessed and viewed online at any time.
The **OpenJDK sources** are “mirrored” in these repositories so that they can be viewed directly
online in the same places for a simplified overview.
In addition to the source code, the repositories also contain the technical documentation.

These are the most important Temurin repositories in GitHub:

- [Temurin build scripts](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build)
- [Build scripts of the Temurin installers](https://github.com/adoptium/installer)
- [Build scripts of the Temurin Docker containers](https://github.com/adoptium/containers)
- [Source code of the OpenJDK](https://github.com/adoptium/jdk)

The Adoptium Working Group uses various online services to make the construction of Temurin runtime environments,
statistics on downloads and the results of tests and validations of the runtime environments publicly available.
This information can be viewed at the following services:

- [Temurin build server](https://ci.adoptium.net/)
- [API for the programmatic download of Temurin](https://api.adoptium.net/q/swagger-ui/)
- [Statistics on Temurin downloads](https://dash.adoptium.net/)

The artifacts of the runtime environment are also published on GitHub and old versions are not removed.
In addition to the pure downloads, the Adoptium Working Group also offers official Docker containers for Temurin.
These are openly accessible in the Docker Hub.

The respective downloads are available here:

- [Temurin LTS releases (11, 17, 21, ...)](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/releases/)
- [Other versions (8, 16, 18, ...) can be accessed in the archive](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/archive/)
- [Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin)

## Who takes care of the maintenance and servicing of the Java runtime environment?

To ensure that your company's own Java applications are **secure and efficient in the long term**,
not only the application itself, but also its runtime environment should be regularly maintained and updated.

### Why is it so important to regularly maintain open source software?

Java is constantly being updated, and there are rarely people in the company who are always up to date.
It is not only important to know about your own application, but also about the runtime environment.
Its functionality is in turn a prerequisite for the functionality of your own application.
A **professional support service** can help here.

{{< centered-image src="tree.svg"  alt="Support" width="80%" >}}

Java is now part of the **critical infrastructure** of many companies and is often used in different versions
within a company.
At Temurin, several Long Term Support (LTS) versions are actively maintained and further developed with
regular updates.
Even today, this can only be made possible in part by the money from commercial support contracts.
The increasing number of LTS versions used in companies also increases the maintenance effort as well
as the required know-how about the respective versions and their differences.
A support service offers assistance in maintenance and migration as well as active training for your
own employees.

#### Webbinars & Meetings

Don't have time to read all the news about Java or would you like an even more detailed explanation with
the opportunity to ask questions?
We organize **webinars for our customers** every quarter, in which all important information about Temurin,
other Adoptium projects and the OpenJDK is presented in a prepared form.
In addition, every customer is invited to **1-on-1 calls** once a quarter.
This can be used to ask open questions and to bring their own needs and wishes to the committees of
Temurin, Adoptium and OpenJDK.

{{< centered-image src="pictogram-training.svg" alt="Piktogram training" width="24%" >}}

OpenJDK and where it can be submitted.
We guarantee the creation, maintenance and monitoring of technically meaningful tickets in the
correct ticket systems.
As far as possible, we will implement change requests directly.
The entire process is passed on to you in a transparent form at all times.

Depending on the scope of support, the support contract can be individually adapted to your needs.

{{< centered-image src="pictogram-support.svg" alt="Piktogram support" width="24%" >}}

#### Maintenance service

Temurin Support & Care includes the maintenance of **Docker containers** tailored to the customer.
These contain everything you need to run your application:
Temurin as a runtime environment, system tools, settings and system libraries.
This allows you to run the latest Temurin versions as containers on the operating system of your choice.
The containers are provided in a Docker registry and kept up to date in line with the Temurin release cycle.
Depending on the container type, maintenance also includes automatic testing of the container images.
