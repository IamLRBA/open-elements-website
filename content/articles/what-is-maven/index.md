Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool designed primarily for Java-based applications.
Its primary purpose is to automate the processes of software compilation, testing, packaging, and deployment, reducing manual effort and errors in managing complex builds.

{{< centered-image src="/illustrations/logos/apache-maven-logo.svg" width="50%" alt="Logo of Apache Maven">}}

Apache Maven is based on the concept of the Project Object Model (POM), an XML file that serves as the blueprint for project configuration.
This declarative approach allows developers to define dependencies, plugins, and build configurations in a centralized manner, enabling consistency and scalability across development environments.

### The Reach of Apache Maven
Apache Maven is one of the most widely used tools in the Java ecosystem.
**Over 75%** of Java projects rely on Maven for their build and project management needs.
With **1.97 billion plugin downloads** annually and **105 million downloads** in 2022–2023, it is a foundational tool in modern software development, spanning projects of all sizes from startups to large enterprises.

### Open-Source Nature
Apache Maven is an open-source tool maintained under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), meaning it is free to use, modify, and distribute.
As part of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org), Maven benefits from an active community that provides updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

To address the growing challenges of maintaining such a critical open-source tool, the **Support & Care for Apache Maven™** initiative was launched.
This program ensures the long-term sustainability of Maven through public funding and community-driven development.

## Importance of Build Automation in a Software Supply Chain
In modern software development, build automation is essential for improving efficiency and minimizing manual intervention in tasks such as:

- Compiling source code.
- Resolving and downloading dependencies.
- Running tests.
- Packaging and deploying applications.

As the **de facto standard** for Java build tools, Maven simplifies these processes with unparalleled reliability and scalability.
Its ability to automate complex workflows ensures that developers can focus on innovation rather than repetitive tasks.

Maven enables:

- **Reproducibility:** Ensuring consistent builds across environments (local, staging, production).
- **Scalability:** Simplifying collaboration in large teams by managing dependencies and enforcing standard conventions.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Serving as a backbone for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

Maven’s structured approach, supported by its reliance on a single configuration file (`pom.xml`), makes it a foundational tool in software engineering workflows, especially for enterprise-grade applications.

## Benefits of Using Apache Maven
Apache Maven offers several benefits that significantly enhance the efficiency, security and quality of software development.
From simplifying complex tasks like dependency management to streamlining collaboration, Maven provides a comprehensive solution for modern development workflows.

### Simplifies Dependency Management
Maven automates dependency management by downloading and resolving libraries declared in the `pom.xml` file.
It also handles transitive dependencies, eliminating version conflicts and reducing manual work.
This ensures that all required components are available without additional effort.

### Standardizes Project Structure
Maven’s standardized project layout simplifies organization and reduces confusion.
Developers can quickly adapt to any Maven project thanks to its fixed directory structure (e.g., `src/main/java` for code, `src/test/java` for tests).
This consistency improves maintainability and collaboration.

### Enhances Security in Software Development
Maven ensures dependencies are sourced from trusted repositories, minimizing risks from malicious components.
Its reproducible builds guarantee consistent results across environments, enhancing stability and simplifying audits.
Maven plugins also supports generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), offering transparency into dependencies and ensuring compliance
with standards like the [US Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
and the [EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act).

### Integrates Seamlessly with IDEs and CI/CD Pipelines
Maven works seamlessly with IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse, allowing developers to execute build goals directly within their environment.
It integrates effortlessly with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins and GitLab CI, enabling automated, repeatable builds triggered by commits or pull requests, boosting productivity and consistency.

## Future of Apache Maven: Sustainability, Security, and Support

Apache Maven has long been a cornerstone of the Java ecosystem, providing developers with a reliable and efficient tool for managing complex build processes.
Its structured approach, reliance on the Project Object Model (POM), and wide adoption (over 75% of Java projects) demonstrate its indispensable role in modern software development.
As Java continues to evolve with new features and standards, the importance of maintaining tools like Maven cannot be overstated.

In recent years, the critical role of open-source software in global infrastructure has become increasingly clear to governments and major industry players.
Tools like Apache Maven are not just developer utilities; they are integral components of digital economies, enabling innovation and reducing costs.
However, the challenges of relying on volunteer-driven development models for such critical software have prompted a paradigm shift.
Governments, through initiatives like the Sovereign Tech Fund, and companies are recognizing the need to invest in the sustainability of open-source projects to ensure their continued relevance and security.

This growing awareness has laid the groundwork for innovative solutions like the Support & Care for Apache Maven™ initiative, which seeks to address the unique challenges faced by projects like Maven.
This initiative represents a transformative approach, combining public funding, community collaboration, and long-term planning to secure the future of Maven and, by extension, the Java ecosystem.

### Support & Care for Apache Maven™ {id="support-care-maven"}

Support & Care for Apache Maven™ is a groundbreaking initiative launched by Open Elements with the goal of ensuring the long-term sustainability of Apache Maven.
It is supported by funding from the Sovereign Tech Fund, a German government program dedicated to safeguarding critical open-source software.
The initiative focuses on providing financial and organizational resources to address longstanding challenges in maintaining and improving Maven.

{{< centered-image src="/illustrations/support-care-logos/support-care-maven-logo.svg" width="80%" alt="Logo of Support & Care for Apache Maven">}}

With the launch of the Support & Care for Apache Maven™ initiative, the future of Maven looks brighter than ever. This program aims to:

- **Provide Long Term Support (LTS):** Businesses can rely on stable, secure Maven versions with predictable update cycles, reducing risks and improving planning for critical systems.
- **Enhance Security Compliance:** The initiative addresses new security requirements outlined in the
  [US Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
  and the [EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act).
  By implementing features like SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) and OpenSSF-Scorecards, Maven ensures compliance with modern cybersecurity standards.
- **Transparent Community-Driven Development:** Public funding, secured through the Sovereign Tech Fund, enables Open Elements to collaborate with the Maven community to prioritize essential updates,
  bug fixes, and new features. Transparent processes and open discussions on platforms like GitHub keep the community at the center of the project’s roadmap.
- **Expand Accessibility:** The creation of tutorials, improved documentation, and multi-language resources (English and German) ensures that both new and experienced developers can
  fully leverage Maven’s capabilities.

This Support & Care initiative by Open Elements not only secures Maven’s relevance for the Java ecosystem but also sets a precedent for sustainable and community-oriented Open-Source development models.
