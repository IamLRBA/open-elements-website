**Open Elements** has initiated a crucial contribution to securing a key tool in the Java ecosystem with its program **Support & Care for Apache Maven™**.
With support from the [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/), sustainable funding for Apache Maven™ is enabled for the first time—one of the most widely used open-source projects in the world.

## The Importance of Apache Maven
Apache Maven is more than just a build tool—it is an essential backbone for developing and managing Java projects.
It supports developers by automating recurring tasks such as dependency management, build processes, and testing.
With around 75% of Java projects using Maven and an average of 1.97 billion downloads per year, Maven is a core component of the global Java community.
It is used by companies of all sizes, from startups to global corporations, and has established itself as the standard for managing Java projects.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com), a global leader in modern software development tools, emphasizes the importance of Maven:
> The open-source tool Maven is indispensable for us at Docker, as it is used as an industry-standard technology in the Java ecosystem.
> Every release of our software Testcontainers for Java is tested for compatibility with current Maven versions.
> Sustainable support, such as the initiative launched by Open Elements, is crucial for the long-term stability of critical open-source components",

More details about Apache Maven can be found [here]({{< relref "articles/what-is-maven" >}})—from how it works and its benefits to the community that supports the project.

## Support by the Sovereign Tech Agency
The Sovereign Tech Agency (STA) is a funding program of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action that focuses on the sustainable support of open-source software.
The program aims to secure critical digital infrastructures in the long term and strengthen the resilience of the European technology ecosystem.
Projects funded by the STA must have significant importance for the economy and society and must also follow sustainable development practices.

Open Elements successfully submitted the funding application for Support & Care for Apache Maven™ under the STA. This process included several steps:

- **Payment of developers and maintainers:** For the first time, developers are paid for their work on Maven to efficiently implement critical tasks such as security updates, bug fixes, and tool enhancements.
- **Creation of a roadmap and milestone planning:** Funded projects are prioritized in collaboration with the community.
  The goals and progress are transparently documented in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care).
- **Focus on security:** Maven components are equipped with SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) and [OpenSSF Scorecards](https://openssf.org/projects/scorecard/).
  These measures meet the requirements of current regulations such as the [U.S. Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
  and the [EU Cyber Resilience Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act).
- **Documentation and tutorials:** In addition to technical documentation, tutorials for beginners are being developed to make Maven more accessible.
  These resources will be available free of charge in German and English.
- **Long-term stability through LTS versions:** Long Term Support (LTS) versions will be provided for the most commonly used Maven versions,
  enabling companies, in particular, to use a stable and predictable tool.
- **Coordination and organization:** A small portion of the funds will be used for project administration to ensure that the resources are used efficiently and purposefully.

These targeted measures not only ensure the technical development of Maven but also lay the foundation for a sustainable future for the project and the entire Java ecosystem.

## Transparency and Sustainability in Focus

A key component of the program is the **transparent management** of funding.
Open Elements is committed to ensuring that **100% of the financial support flows directly into Maven development**.
Only a small portion of the resources is used for the project's organization and administration.

The program's progress is shared through a public roadmap and regular updates in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/support-and-care/maven-support-and-care).
The community is invited to contribute suggestions and feedback to shape Maven's future together.

## Who Works on Support & Care for Apache Maven™?

Both Open Elements employees and external developers and maintainers are working together to implement the project.
While Open Elements handles project management and coordination, external developers and Apache Maven maintainers are primarily responsible for the technical implementation.
In this process, Open Elements collaborates closely not only with individual developers but also with the entire Maven community.

Falk Sippach of embarc Software Consulting GmbH describes the collaboration on [Heise Developer](https://www.heise.de/blog/Java-Einladung-zur-Mitgestaltung-des-Programms-Support-Care-for-Apache-Maven-9718336.html) as follows:  
> The trust that the Maven community places in Open Elements as a transparent player in the open-source field is unique and makes this initiative possible in the first place.

## A Model Project for Open Source

With Support & Care for Apache Maven™, Open Elements is setting a strong precedent for the sustainable support of open-source projects.
This program serves as a pilot project within the Support & Care Initiative by Open Elements, which aims to promote other critical open-source components.

The concept combines public funding, transparent resource management, and active community involvement.
It demonstrates how essential open-source projects can be future-proofed while also fostering innovation—a model approach for other open-source projects.

## A Step Towards Sustainability

Support & Care for Apache Maven™ is more than just a funding project—it is the first step of Open Elements' comprehensive Support & Care Initiative.
This initiative aims to promote and future-proof further critical open-source components sustainably.
